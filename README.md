# Launchdeck
VB6 fast application launcher

## What it can do
- Stay in the system tray like a good boy until you open it
- Open whatever shortcut you tell it to like a good boy
- Import your start menu items as shortcuts like a good boy so you don't need to create them manually
- Help you remove the shortcuts you don't need like a good boy
- Exit like a good boy
- Shutdown or restart your computer like a good boy (9x only)
- Work on Windows 98, 2000 and upward (95 untested but probably works) and also in WINE like a good boy

## What it can't do (yet)
- Figure out incomplete shortcut names/autocomplete (so in this sense it's kinda like Spotlight but not as smart. still a good boy anyway)
- Shutdown/restart NT-based systems

## Verdict
Launchdeck is a very good boy
